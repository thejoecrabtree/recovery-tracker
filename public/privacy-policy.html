  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Recovery Tracker is a personal fitness tracking progressive web app (PWA). Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All workout data, settings, and preferences are stored locally on your device using your browser's localStorage. No data is sent to or stored on external servers.</p>

  <h2>Whoop Integration</h2>
  <p>If you connect your Whoop account, we use the Whoop API to read your recovery scores and sleep data. This data is used solely to personalize your workout recommendations and is stored locally on your device. We access the following Whoop data:</p>
  <ul style="color: #94a3b8; font-size: 0.95rem;">
    <li>Recovery scores</li>
    <li>Sleep performance data</li>
    <li>Basic profile information</li>
    <li>Body measurements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>OAuth tokens are stored locally and are never shared with third parties. You can disconnect Whoop at any time from the Settings page, which deletes all stored tokens.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This app does not use analytics, advertising, or any third-party tracking services. Exercise demonstration links open YouTube in a new tab, subject to YouTube's own privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, share, or transmit your personal data to any third parties. Your workout data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.</p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete all your data at any time using the "Reset All Data" option in the app's Settings page. You can also clear your browser's localStorage to remove all app data.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/thejoecrabtree/recovery-tracker">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
